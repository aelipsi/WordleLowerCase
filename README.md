# Wordle Lowercase Mode

This project provides a uBlock filter list that ensures that Wordle guesses are displayed using lowercase letters.

## Why?

Consider the following lists of letters:
PLAYS		plays
THEIR		their
SLOSH		slosh
TROCE		troce
SHASH		shash



These lists are exactly the same. However, the lowercase version feels much more familiar. In normal reading and writing of English, people will encounter proper capitalization. Therefore, in general, people are most familiar with the lowercase version of words.

## Configuration

Please follow the [https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists#3rd-party-filter-lists](uBlock documentation) for adding a 3rd-party filter list.

## Note

This project is not associated with Wordle, any of its derivatives, uBlock, or any of its derivatives.
